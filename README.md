# Happy Thoughts 💭

Happy Thoughts is a fullstack web application where users can share short thoughts, like other users’ thoughts, and manage their own content. The project started as a frontend-only React app and has since evolved into a complete fullstack application with authentication, authorization, and a custom-built API.

The frontend is built with React and communicates with a RESTful backend API to handle authentication, data fetching, and updates in real time.
